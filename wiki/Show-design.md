## What Blender version is Skybrush Studio compatible with?

Our commitment is to support full compatibility with the latest LTS release of Blender at all times. The current version of the plugin may or may not work with older versions, though. If you find an issue with the plugin that might be related to Blender's version, install the latest LTS version of Blender first and try again. If the problem persists, feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/skybrush-io/studio-blender/issues/new).
