## Is there collision avoidance between the drones during a show?

No, by default all drones follow preprogrammed flight paths individually, which should be designed and validated before flight to have a safe minimal distance between drones at all times. The only drone show system we know of that implements onboard real-time collision avoidance during flight is our own system at CollMot Robotics Ltd., where drones communicate with each other actively and avoid possible collisions using custom swarm intelligence.
