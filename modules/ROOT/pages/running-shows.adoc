== Do I need active internet connection during drone light shows?

You don't necessarily need active internet connection during drone shows.
You should be connected to the local network of the drones created by your dedicated router to access them from Skybrush Live.
However, there are a few handy features in Skybrush Live that require access to data on the internet, such as the weather widget that attempts to retreive latest Kp-index or any tile server that provides your map tiles.
For what it's worth, you can always buy a 4G mobile wifi dongle and connect it via USB to your laptop to also have internet connection along with your local network connection.
