## What are the government regulations to fly a drone swarm?

The response to this question (just like many of the legal issues) is highly country-specific. See the responses below for individual country-specific rules.

### Canada

In Canada, the national aviation authority is Transport Canada. Transport Canada refers to drones as RPAs (Remotely Piloted Aircraft). Rules governing RPAs are in section 901 of the CARs (Canadian Aviation Regulations).
Every pilot of an RPA must hold either a:

- Basic RPA Pilot Certificate
- Advanced RPA Pilot Certificate

Basic or Advanced pilots may fly up to 5 RPAs from a single Control Station under CAR 901.40(1). To fly more that 5 RPAs in a swarm, an SFOC (Special Flight Operations Certificate) is required. Only Advanced RPA pilots may apply for an SFOC.
